## Straw Man

**Definition:**  
A straw man fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.

**Example:**  
Person A: We should invest more in public transportation.  
Person B: My opponent wants to take away everyone's cars.

**My Analysis:**  
Person A merely expressed their opinion about increasing investment in public transportation.  
Instead of addressing A's argument, Person B deliberately distorted it and attacked this misrepresented version.  
This is a clear example of a straw man fallacy.
